# Amazon Budgeting Chrome Extension (aka Fiber)

The Fiber Chrome Extension was our entry for the 2019 Intern Onboarding Hackathon at Capital One. After two rounds of judging projects by 540 software engineering interns, this extension won first place.

It is common for individuals to make a personal budget to ensure they can pay their bills every month and still have spending money. However, it is difficult to constantly check and remember the various budget categories set, and many people quickly give up or forget. This chrome extension is meant to help with this situation and improve Amazon shoppers' financial literacy by integrating their budget & credit card data directly into the Amazon's. The data is easy to understand provides warnings and recommendations to users.

## Future Work

We only had 24 hours to come up with our idea, plan, code, and prepare our presentations. If we were to continue developing this extension, we would consider adding the following features:
- Adding support for additional websites such as Walmart and eBay
- Adding support for generic websites (i.e., attempting to identify shopping webpages based on html content and adding budget information as necessary)
- Category-based budgeting
- Adding APIs for Capital One, Intuit's Mint, and other companies which manage user's financial data so they can be displayed
- General bugfixing of the extension within Amazon
